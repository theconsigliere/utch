If there are roots showing through the drainage holes in the bottom of your pot, it is probably time to consider repotting. We recommend only going up a pot size at a time and repotting on a yearly(ish) basis. Cacti and succulents like to be particularly pot bound and can be left in cramped conditions. However, if you do not repot particularly often, it becomes important to feed your plants in the summer months to replace any lost nutrients."

It's almost certainly nothing too problematic and the odd brown or yellowing leaf is an important part of a plants lifecycle. However, if you're getting brown tips on the end of multiple leaves, chances are it's a humidity issue. Particularly in the winter with central heating turned on, your air will be a lot drier than your plants are used to. To combat browning tips, try regular misting of your tropical houseplants. You can also sit them on a tray containing pebbles and a small reservoir of water which will help to generate further humidity."

If it is only lower leaves that are yellowing, it may be that these are unable to get as much natural light as leaves further up the plant. Have a look at where your plant is positioned and how often you are watering it. Watering regimes vary significantly from plant to plant, but a good proportion of houseplants do not like to be waterlogged or sit in water for too long; allowing the top of the soil to dry out before watering is a good rule of thumb."
